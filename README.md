# ItemClassification
Implementation of various neural network models, which were used to classify items to multiple classes. Each item in datalist belongs to only one class. 
Neural networks were created by Python Keras package. At the end of training neural networks were able to classify items with more than 97% accuracy and precision. In validation were also gained simmilar results.
Data in this repository are hidded due to its specification, but after small changes notebooks can be trained also on other data.
